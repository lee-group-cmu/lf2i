## Getting Started

### What is LFI?
`lf2i` is a Python package for likelihood-free inference; that is, inference on the internal parameters :math:`\boldsymbol{\theta}` of a statistical model (or theory) :math:`F_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}` in a setting where the likelihood :math:`\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}; \mathcal{D}):=p(\mathcal{D}|\boldsymbol{\theta})` cannot be evaluated but is *implicitly* encoded by a high-fidelity simulator for :math:`F_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}`. That is, one can simulate data with samples of size :math:`n`, :math:`\mathcal{D}=(X_1, \dots, X_n)`,  for any given :math:`\boldsymbol{\theta}` in the parameter space.

### What does LF2I do?
`lf2i` constructs confidence regions for internal parameters with correct *conditional coverage*, that is, sets :math:`\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{D})` satisfying :math:`\mathbb{P}({\boldsymbol{\theta}} \in \mathcal{R}(\mathcal{D}) | {\boldsymbol{\theta}}) = 1 - \alpha`, where :math:`(1 − \alpha) \in (0, 1)` is a prespecified confidence level.\
Conditional coverage is guaranteed regardless of
1. the prior distribution over the parameters of interest;
2. the true value of the parameters of interest: the coverage guarantee holds point-wise over the parameter space (i.e., not only on average); and
3. the size of the observed sample: the coverage guarantee holds even for finite sample sizes, including for the case of one observation, i.e. :math:`n=1`.

### How is LF2I structured?
`lf2i` is based on the equivalence of confidence sets and hypothesis tests. It leverages supervised machine learning methods to efficiently execute the Neyman construction of confidence sets. The `lf2i` framework has three separate modules for, respectively, estimating 
1. test statistics,
2. critical values for a level-:math:`\alpha` test, and
3. empirical conditional coverage,

across the entire parameter space. See the figure below for a schematic diagram.\

While *1.* and *2.* are used to construct the confidence sets, *3.* is a diagnostic tool that can be used to check whether a given parameter region (such as, `lf2i` confidence sets, posterior credible regions, prediction sets, etc …) has the right conditional coverage. Because the `lf2i` method itself is modular, users can construct valid confidence sets using any test statistic of their choice. 

### Usage
`lf2i` offers a simple interface that allows you to get started quickly. The entry point is in the `lf2i.inference.lf2i` module, which contains classes to wrap the different functionalities. The method `infer` merges steps *1.* and *2.* to return confidence sets with correct coverage. The method `diagnose` performs step *3.* as an independent check of empirical coverage of the final confidence sets.
